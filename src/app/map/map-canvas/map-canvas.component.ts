    the event will trigger. This is a result of the internal logic of click events,
    which only watch to see if your click is in the same element when you lift your finger.
    That doesn't work with our canvas, which is a giant element.

    Instead of using a click event, we have an if check that better simulates click events.
    This checks to see if you lift your finger in just about the same area as where you started a click.
    This prevents weird issues with dragging.
